# Knot Theory Planning

## Week One

### Day One: Monday, Jan 09

IDEA: Do a day on a sorting game. Give the students lots of knots in various forms
and ask them to sort out which are the same and which are different. Bring
paracord, pipe cleaners. Bring lots of my own examples, including 3d printed knots.
Have students make other knots and add them to the list.

Goals:

  - regular projections as reasonable representations
  - intuition on same vs different
  - student creativity in making some knots
  - collect conjectures

Homework for Wednesday: determine which of the student made knots are equivalent
to other knots/links from our list, or each other. Which others are different?

### Day Two: Wednesday, Jan 11

games: crossing number, unknotting number, alternating-ness

### Day Three: Friday, Jan 13

games: mirrors, orientations, inverses

## Week Two

### Day Four: Wednesday, Jan 18

games: primes and composites

### Day Five: Friday, Jan 20

games: knot notations

## Week Three

### Day Six: Monday, Jan 23

First Discussion on knots as polygonal curves and $\Delta$-equivalence.
section 2.1 of the text, with exercises.

### Day Seven: Wednesday, Jan 25

Discussion of section 2.2, up to lemma 2.2.6. (read that far!) we may not
discuss the details, but it will take two readings (at least).

### Day Eight: Wednesday, Jan 27

More discussion of section 2.2, lemma 2.2.6 and the following two exercises

 -- we got through 2.2.9 discussion of option (b). Homework: make list for (c).

## Week Four

### Day Nine: Monday, Jan 30

Finish discussion of section 2.2. notion R-equivalence

### Day Ten: Wednesday: Feb 1

section 2.3 discussion: $\Delta$-equivalence is same as R-equivalence.

### Day Eleven: Friday, Feb 3

TJ out of town!! class finishes discussion of delta vs R and sets up for using
equivalence as basis for invariants!

- Mark to lead that day?
