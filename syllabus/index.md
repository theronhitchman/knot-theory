#### Math 4159/5159, Spring 2017


### Course Description

We shall study the basics of knot theory: a branch of topology which studies the
different ways to embed a circle into space. Our main questions for the semester
are these:

  - What exactly is a knot? What are some examples?
  - How can we represent a knot more compactly?
  - How can we tell if two knots are really "the same"?
  - How can we tell if two knots are really "different"?

### Basic Details

- **Instructor:** Theron J Hitchman
- **Course Meetings:** MWF 10-11am, WRT 105
- **Texts:** not yet in print, but coming soon, see below

### Materials

The course text is _An Interactive Introduction to Knot Theory_ by Inga Johnson and
Allison Henrich (ISBN: 978-0486804637). This will be published by Dover Publications
and released on January 18th. Until then, I will have plenty of stuff for us to do.

You may also wish to obtain some lengths of paracord, some shoelaces, some string,
some pipe cleaners, or other things which might be turned into actual physical
representations of knots. This is optional, but helpful.

### Learning Objectives

Students will improve their basic mathematical skills: finding novel and creative
arguments for mathematical truths, and making arguments that back up their findings.

Knot theory is a geometrical subject with lots of visualization, so students will
likely improve their visualization and sketching skills.

And of course, students will learn some answers to the main questions listed above.


### Assessment:

Course grades will be based on four parts:

  - regular work of figuring out what is true and presenting arguments to the class.
  - three examinations
  - a final project centered around reading some literature in knot theory, with a poster presentation

Graduate Students will also work on a second individual project. This will have a
preliminary due date near April 10, and then be delivered through a presentation to
the class during week 15.

The basic grading rubric is as follows:

| Undergrad Mark | Graduate Mark |                                             Work Expected                                             |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                |       A       |                   Long term project with  in-class presentation & work listed below                   |
|        A       |       B       |                                Final poster project & work listed below                               |
|        B       |       C       |             Some instances of producing arguments for sharing in class & work listed below            |
|        C       |       D       | Competently demonstrate mastery  of basic ideas on exams  & regular participation in class activities |
|        D       |       F       |                  Regular participation in class, but fail to reproduce ideas on exams                 |
|        F       |               |                                   Fail to meet the standards for a D                                  |


### Dates to Watch:

- Wednesday, February 15: First Midterm Exam, in class
- Wednesday, March 29: Second Midterm Exam, in class
- Monday, April 24: Final Midterm Exam, in class
- Monday, May 1: Project Poster Presentation Day (Final Exam Period)



### Student Academic Accommodations

Please address any special needs or special accommodations with me at the beginning of the semester or as soon as you become aware of your needs. Those seeking accommodations based on disabilities should obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) form from Student Disability Services (SDS) (phone 319-273-2677, for deaf or hard of hearing, use Relay 711). SDS is located on the top floor of the Student Health Center, Room 103.
