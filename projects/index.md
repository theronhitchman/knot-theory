title: Semester Project ideas
---

Some ideas for end-of-semester projects. The split into undergraduate and graduate student projects is just an approximation. If something on here seems
really interesting to you, we can probably make it work.

### Undergraduates

- Hard unknots
- stick knots
- petal knots
- knot mosaics
- Conway-Gordon theorem on linked triangles in K6
- arc presentations and the arc index
- mutants
- cable knots, satellites, doubles, etc
- knot tabulation

    * Dowker-Thistlethwaite method
    * Conway's method

- wild knots
- the theorems of Fenchel and Fary-Milnor
- Montesinos knots
- symmetries of knots

### Graduates

- Seifert surfaces and the genus
- braids and the braid group
- Thurston's theorem: knots are either torus knots, satellites, or hyperbolic
- knot groups
- quandles for knots
- Murasugi's theorem relating crossing number and bridge index for alternating knots
- higher dimensional knotting
- knots in the Lorenz equations
