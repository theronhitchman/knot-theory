## Exam One

The first exam will be Wednesday, February 15 in class. To prepare, I ask that
you do the following assignment.

For Monday, February 13 write up the following, which should fit in 1-2 pages.

  * An outline of what we have done so far in our five weeks of study. Focus
  on the big picture rather than a pile of details. Don't try to make an
  exhaustive list. Instead, try to choose what things are important structure
  to include, but leave out less important details.
  * Two questions which would make good exam questions. And "good" does not
  mean "hard" or "tricky." It means, is a reasonable test of someone's
  understanding of the first few weeks of the course.

This is to prepare for both our discussion on Monday and the exam on Wednesday.
(A really good study technique is to review and outline the things you have
learned, and make a decent list of those things you don't understand as well
as you want.)

If any of your exam questions are really good, I'll use them.
