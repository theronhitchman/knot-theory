title: More Tiny Triangles, Really?

We made an outline of how to prove Theorem 2.3.1 by putting together our work so
far. The biggest remaining task is to figure out how to divide a "big"
elementary triangle into smaller ones with this important property:

  There are at most two segments from our link lying above or below
  the elementary triangle.

We are good and stuck on this.

### For Friday

Please try to finish that task. With your remaining time, look at Exercises
2.3.4 and 2.3.5, which are much more fun.

I won't be here on Friday, but you should meet and work through as much as you
can.

### For Monday

Read and prepare section 3.1, on the class of twist knots.
