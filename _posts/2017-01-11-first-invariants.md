We talked about three geometric invariants of knots today: the _crossing
number_, the _unknotting number_, and the quality of being _alternating_.
It is important to note that the first two are quantitative in nature because
one associates a number to a knot, but the third is qualitative (and binary)
because a knot is either alternating or it isn't. [see what I did there?]

I used the following examples today:

  * a disguised trefoil,
  * a trefoil \\(3_1\\),
  * the six-crossing knot \\(6_3\\),
  * the seven-crossing knot \\(7_4\\), and
  * Goeritz's unknot.

You can find more about these, and diagrams from the site
[KnotInfo](http://www.indiana.edu/~knotinfo/). Well, for the last one you might
need to do a Google Search.

### For Friday:

1. Check which of the knots and links from our table is alternating, which
aren't. [I did it again.]
2. Find a sequence of diagrams which helps show that Goeritz's unknot really is
the unknot.

## UPDATE

I don't want to forget that Eric (the charm one) asked a really interesting
question, which brought us to discuss Peter Guthrie Tait and one of his famous
conjectures:

> *Conjecture:* [P.G. Tait, ca. 1880] Any reduced diagram of an alternating
link has the fewest possible crossings.

We haven't talked about what "reduced" means, yet. Don't worry, we'll come back
to this later.
