We started by playing with some knots. So far, we have come across these basic
but important ideas:

  * What is a knot?
  * How should we represent them on a page?
  * How could we tell if two links are the same thing?
  * How could we tell if two links are genuinely different?

The questions there are the basic questions of knot theory, and we will learn
some of what humanity has devised as answers.

For Wednesday, please try to figure out if each of the pairs of links from our
little table is either the same or different. There are
\\[ \binom{15}{2} = 15\times 7 = 105\\]
such pairs, so you won't figure them all out. That's okay. Do what you can.
