Today we had a discussion about the first exam, which will be in class on Wednesday.

I have scanned the set of outlines and exam questions you made and sent them
by email. You can also find them [here]({{site.baseurl}}/images/KnotTheory-Exam1-StudentPrep.pdf).

### For Wednesday

Prepare for the exam.

### For Friday

Please read as much of section 3.4 as you can. The big result here is that any
knot can be arranged as a "closed braid." This is a way to generalize the
idea of a torus knot.  I bet it will take us a while to work through all of
this. Can we get all the way through Exercise 3.4.10 on Friday? Probably knot.

I do hope to finish all of chapter 3 by the end of next week, if not sooner.
