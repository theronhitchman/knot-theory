We discussed two new concepts today: the mirror image of a knot, and the reverse
of an oriented knot. We looked at four examples: \\( 3_1 \\) (the trefoil),
\\( 4_1 \\) (the figure eight knot), \\( 5_2 \\), and \\( 8_{15} \\). You can find
each of these on the site KnotInfo.

### For Wednesday

There seem to be two ways of making a mirror image. Given a knot K, you could
make a new knot K' by changing all of the crossings of K. Or, you could
reflect the knot diagram of K across some line in the plane to get a new knot
K''.

  * Show that K' and K'' are always equivalent.

This allows us to speak unabmiguously about the mirror image of a knot. A knot
is called _achiral_ (or _amphichiral_) when it is equivalent to its
mirror image. A knot is called _chiral_ when it is not equivalent to its mirror
image. I mentioned in class that the trefoil knot is chiral, but proving this is
challenging and will have to wait until we build some tools.

  * Show that the figure eight knot \\(4_1\\) is achiral by drawing a sequence
  of knot diagrams between \\(4_1\\) and its mirror image with easily understood
  steps.

We also talked about how a knot can be given a "sense of travel", called an
_orientation_. Each knot has two of these of course. A knot together with a
choice of orientation is called an _oriented knot_. If K is an oriented knot,
the knot Kr with the opposite orientation is called the _reverse_ of K.

If we carry the orientations along as we look for equivalent knots, we can talk
about oriented equivalence of oriented knots. Some oriented knots are oriented
equivalent to their reverses, and some aren't. [See what I did there?] An
oriented knot which is oriented equivalent to its reverse is called
_invertible._ Of course, sometimes we just say a knot is invertible when its
two orientations are oriented equivalent.

  * Show that the knot \\(8_{15}\\) is invertible by finding a sequence of
  oriented knot diagrams between its two orientations.
