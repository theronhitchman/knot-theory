Welcome to Math 4159/5159 _Knot Theory_. This course is new and _experimental_.
I am busy making final decisions, and the [syllabus][] will get finished before
class begins.

[syllabus]: {{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/index.html

At this point, there are a mix of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled.
The main spirit of the course will be the same for all, but I will expect a combination
of (1) better results, and (2) more work from the graduate students.

I am very excited to get started. See you Monday!
