title: Knots as Polygons and Delta Equivalence
date: 2017-01-23 19:30

We transitioned to the reading seminar phase of our course. We talked through
section 2.1 of the text, including how the idea of a knot is realized as a
simple, closed polygonal curve in space. The biggest part of our discussion
was about the notion of <span>\(\Delta\)</span>-equivalence for knots.

We had a group discussion of Exercise 2.1.4. Daniel shared his solution to
2.1.8. Both Mark and Daniel shared their solutions to 2.1.9. We did not get to
exercise 2.1.10.

### For Wednesday

Please read section 2.2 through Lemma 2.2.6. We probably won't get to a
discussion of this lemma, but I think it might need two readings. So we might as
well do the first one right away.
