Today we talked about some aspects of breaking a big, chunky,
<span>\\( \Delta \\)</span>-move into little pieces of controllable types. These
types will include the following:

* planar isotopies, which don't change the crossing information,
* R1 moves, which either create or destroy a single crossing by adding a twist,
* R2 moves, which either create or destroy a pair of consecutive over
(or under) crossings, and
* R3 moves, which pull a strand from one side of a crossing to the other.

We discussed right up to Exercise 2.2.5 today, and saw enough to understand that
our current project is "fiddly."

### For Friday

Please read through Lemma 2.2.6 again, and work up through Exercise 2.2.9.
