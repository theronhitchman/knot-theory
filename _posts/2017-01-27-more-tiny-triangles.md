Yesterday, we talked through some of the basics of reducing a big
<span>\\( \Delta \\)</span>-equivalence elementary move into lots of little elementary moves. The idea is to find some list of possible atomic elementary
moves that we can use to build any desired elementary move.

We talked through Lemma 2.2.6 and Lemma 2.2.7. We introduced several types of
our atomic moves, depending on how the given diagram changes when the move is
made:

    - planar isotopies: these are elementary moves that don't change the
    crossing information of a diagram in any way.
    - R1 move: this creates, or destroys, a single crossing in a diagram by
    introducing or removing a twist.
    - R2 move: this creates, or destroys, a pair of consecutive over crossings.

This last one is just coming to the surface, but I think we have a good
understanding of the first two.

### For Monday

For Monday, try to finish exercise 2.2.9. We made a _very crude_ upper bound
estimate of how many options will happen in the consideration of option (c).
The number (<span>\\(192\\)</span>) is frightening, but I bet the actual number
is much smaller.

If you have some time, move on to the consideration of 2.2.10.
