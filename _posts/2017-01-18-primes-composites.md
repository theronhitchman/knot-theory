title: Primes and Composites

We started with student presentations today. Seth shared his argument for why
reflecting a knot diagram through a line is equivalent to the operation of
"changing all of the crossings." This means that our two ideas of mirror image
coincide, so we can use them interchangeably.

Daniel showed us a sequence of pictures that demonstrate that the figure eight
knot is achiral.

Then I shared my work for why <span>\\(8_{15}\\)</span> is invertible. (I have
  used the textbooks language here. I still want to say "reversible" instead.)

Finally, we had a conversation about the notions of "prime" and "composite"
knots. We saw that forming a composite depends upon orientations, and that
there is a good way to tie your shoes and a bad way. Both ways are composites
of trefoil knots, but one makes a square knot and the other makes a granny knot.
The square knot is superior.

We also discussed how the tables you of knots you find are usually tables of
prime knots.

### For Friday

Please find decompositions of the two nasty knots I gave you into simpler knots.
Can you decompose them all the way down to primes?
