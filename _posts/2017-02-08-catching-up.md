So, with the travel I did, I am a week behind on blog post recaps. Today, we
get up-to-date.

#### Friday, Feb 3

Mark helped lead class in my absence and gave me notes about the proceedings.
It sounds like things went really well. You talked through several methods for
dividing an elementary triangle into sub-triangles which will have no more than
two segments of the link lying above or below them. (Sounds like Daniel and
Eric <strike>Nichols</strike>Charm had methods, and Mark shared Reidemeister's
method.) Then Seth did exercise 2.3.4, and Dan did exercise 2.3.7. Finally,
Mark, Eric <strike>Scheidecker</strike>Strange, and Seth did parts of exercise
2.3.5.

By the way, I would really like to see a solution for knot (iv) in
exercise 2.3.5. If you have that, show me.

### Monday, Feb 6

We discussed twist knots. We did exercise 3.1.2, and then got bogged down in a
loooooooooooooooooong discussion of exercise 3.1.3. After class, Seth sent his
solution for it. I sent that to the class email list.

### Wednesday, Feb 8

We did a lot today! We discussed pretzel links. We had lots of presentations.
section 3.2 \#2 Josh; \#3 "Team Eric"; \#5 Daniel; \#6 TJ; \#7 Seth; \#8 Mark

At the end of the hour, we were discussing the possibility of another approach
to \#8, since Mark's work required some cases.

### About the Exam

**Exam in One Week**

Since a few of you were expressing anxiety about the exam, I thought about it
over my morning planning time. Here is what we will do: I will give you an
assignment for Monday that helps you get ready for the exam. It will require you
to write something up to turn in! (I mention it because that is unusual for our
class.)

Well, I just wrote the assignment up. Maybe you wanna get started thinking
about it? [It is here]({{site.baseurl}}/exam-info/)

### For Friday

Please prepare section 3.3 on torus links.
