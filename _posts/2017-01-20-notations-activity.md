Today we did an activity about creating useful notations for knots. You can find
the [whole set of handouts here][activity]. Also, I had planned to pass out [this knot diagram][11n1diagram] of <span>\\(11n_1\\)</span>
to show the depth of the challenge of making reasonable notations. But it seems
like you got the big ideas already.

We only did the first two parts of the activity I planned, which was enough to
get the point across. I am really pleased at the work you did! At the end of
class, you had basically re-invented something called _Dowker-Thistlethwaite
codes_ and something called _planar diagram codes_. We will talk about those
things later in the term in more depth.

We have completed our initial "playtime" set of activities. It is time for us
start reading the textbook. I hope to run the rest of class as a sort of
reading seminar. We will read, discuss, and present solutions to the exercises.

### For Monday

Read chapter 2 section 1 of Johnson-Henrich and prepare the exercises as best
you can. This is pages 26-29, and includes four exercises.
