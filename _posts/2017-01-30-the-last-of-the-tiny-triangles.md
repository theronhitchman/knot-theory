title: The Last of the Tiny Triangles

We dug in, and tried to finish the discussion about the kinds of "atomic"
elementary moves we should track. First, this involved clarifying that,
in exercise 2.2.9, we are only talking about cases where the two segments
of the link attached to <span>\\(AB\\)</span> DO NOT lie above or below the
triangle <span>\\(\triangle ABC\\)</span>.

So we made some lists of possible arrangements where _two_
segments of the link lie above or below our elementary triangle.
So far, we have found that
in the cases without a multiple point, every elementary move we need involving
two or fewer segments of the link could be reduced to the
following kinds of moves, after perhaps performing a sub-division:

  * planar isotopies,
  * R1 moves which create or destroy a crossing by twisting, or
  * R2 moves which create or destroy pairs of crossings by tucking one
  strand under another.

Then, in some of the cases involving a double point, we saw that a new kind of
move is also necessary, which we will call an R3 move. This involves pulling
one part of the link past a crossing (either over or under).

By the end of things, we had basically discussed items 2.2.9, 2.2.10, and
2.2.11.

### For Wednesday

Please complete exercise 2.2.14 to finish the ideas of section 2.2, and read
on to section 2.3. There are a few really fun exercises hiding there. We will
do as much as we can.
