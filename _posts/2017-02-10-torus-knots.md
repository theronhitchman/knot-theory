We discussed torus links. These are links that can be drawn on the surface of
a torus without any crossings. Or we can imagine drawing them with icing on a
donut.

Some of these were challenging, so we only got a few done: \#2 Devyn (yay!);
\#3 Seth; \#5 Mark; \#6 Daniel.

### For Monday

We will do two things:

1. Prepare for Wednesday's Exam
2. Do leftover exercises

To prepare, please (1) do the assignment described
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/exam-info/), and then spend any extra time you might
have looking into those exercises from Chapter 3 we have not, yet finished.
According to my notes, those are: \#3.2.4 and section 3.3 \# 4,7,8
